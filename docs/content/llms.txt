# Steward

> Steward is the Hosted Control Plane Manager for Kubernetes, enabling multi-tenant, upstream-compliant clusters as pods in a central management cluster. Steward is a community-governed fork of Kamaji, maintained by Butler Labs.

## Overview

Steward runs Kubernetes control planes as pods in a central Management Cluster, enabling fast, scalable, and cost-effective multi-tenancy. Each Tenant Cluster is fully isolated, CNCF-compliant, and managed declaratively using Kubernetes CRDs. Steward integrates with Cluster API, supports GitOps workflows, and provides native Talos Linux worker support.

## Key Concepts

- **Management Cluster:** Hosts Steward and all Tenant Control Planes as pods
- **Tenant Control Plane:** A Kubernetes control plane running as pods, managed by Steward
- **DataStore:** Backend storage for control plane state (etcd, PostgreSQL, MySQL, NATS)

## FAQ

- What is Steward? Steward is a Kubernetes Operator that provides managed Kubernetes control planes as a service.
- How is it different from typical solutions? Steward runs the Control Plane as regular pods in the Management Cluster, making it more cost-effective and easier to operate at scale.
- How does it differ from Cluster API? They complement each other: Steward simplifies Control Plane management, while Cluster API handles infrastructure abstraction and lifecycle management.
- How does Steward relate to Kamaji? Steward is a community-governed fork of Kamaji by Clastix Labs, providing stable releases under the Apache 2.0 license.
