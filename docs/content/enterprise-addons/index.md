# Enterprise Addons

This document contains the documentation of the available Steward addons. 

## What is a Steward Addon

A Steward Addon is a separate component installed in the same Steward cluster.
It offers an additional set of features required for enterprise-grade usage.

The developed Steward addons are closed-source available and work with the upstream Steward edition.

## Distribution of Addons

The Steward Addons are available behind an active [subscription license](https://butlerlabs.io/support/).

Once a subscription is activated, the [BUTLERLABS](https://butlerlabs.io) team will automate the push of required OCI (container images) and Helm Chart artefacts to the customer's OCI-compatible repository.

## Available addons

- [Ingress Addon](/enterprise-addons/ingress): expose Tenant Control Planes behind an Ingress Controller to reduce the amount of required LoadBalancer services
